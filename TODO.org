* To Implement
- see https://www.last.fm/api/
- add tools to mdickens.me
** TODO Forgotten songs
- "forgotten songs": songs you used to listen to but haven't listened to in a while
  - use https://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getWeeklyTrackChart
- Bonus feature: integrate with Spotify to play a random forgotten song
*** Possible algorithms
- (number of listens) * (time since last listen)
- sum[(time since listen) for all listens]
  - doesn't work, it just gives songs with lots of listens
- sum[(time since listen)**2 for all listens]
  - slightly better than above, but same problem
  - if you use a bigger exponent like 8, it still shows songs with tons of listens, but they tend to be ones that I used to listen to more. Not exactly "forgotten", but similar
*** Results
- You need to weight last-played much more heavily than play count, otherwise it will just show you songs with lots of plays
- Sadly, it looks like my last.fm data just isn't old enough to be able to produce a good list of forgotten songs
*** TODO forgotten song examples
convert these into a better algorithm

- on 2020-01-08, listened to Furfur for the first time since 2019-07-31. it had 55 total listens
  - only three total scrobbles in 2019
- on 2020-06-29, listened to Dark Moor – Somewhere in Dreams, which had 0 recorded listens on last.fm
- As of 2020-07-31, Carass – Black Star hasn't had a listen since 2019-04-19 (it got removed from Spotify). but got added back in 2020-08
*** TODO new algorithm to try
[2020-06-29]

Find songs with a long time since last listen that got some minimum number of listens. Maybe sqrt(num listens) * (time since last listen), or just (time since last listen) | (numlistens) >= 5
*** TODO try forgotten artists instead of forgotten songs
** DONE Most-listened songs/albums/artists by play time
** TODO radio where you can dynamically vary song similarity

** TODO Random song chooser
- Given a genre, pick a random song of that genre to listen to
- Can't tell how to actually get genre info out of last.fm API
** TODO Pull recent charts to keep db up to date
** TODO Spotify API
- Track features: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/
- Top artists/tracks: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/personalization/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks/
  - can give top 50 artists/tracks, probably over a longer time period than last.fm (says it goes back "several years")
** Add iTunes listens to last.fm
- Can use https://www.last.fm/api/show/track.scrobble to record scrobbles that happened outside of Spotify
