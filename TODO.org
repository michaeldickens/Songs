* To Implement
- see https://www.last.fm/api/
- add tools to mdickens.me
** DONE Forgotten songs
- "forgotten songs": songs you used to listen to but haven't listened to in a while
  - use https://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getWeeklyTrackChart
- Bonus feature: integrate with Spotify to play a random forgotten song
*** Possible algorithms
- (number of listens) * (time since last listen)
- sum[(time since listen) for all listens]
  - doesn't work, it just gives songs with lots of listens
- sum[(time since listen)**2 for all listens]
  - slightly better than above, but same problem
  - if you use a bigger exponent like 8, it still shows songs with tons of listens, but they tend to be ones that I used to listen to more. Not exactly "forgotten", but similar
*** Results
- You need to weight last-played much more heavily than play count, otherwise it will just show you songs with lots of plays
- Sadly, it looks like my last.fm data just isn't old enough to be able to produce a good list of forgotten songs
** TODO Random song chooser
- Given a genre, pick a random song of that genre to listen to
- Can't tell how to actually get genre info out of last.fm API
** TODO Most-listened songs/albums/artists by play time
** TODO Pull recent charts to keep db up to date
** Add iTunes listens to last.fm
- Can use https://www.last.fm/api/show/track.scrobble to record scrobbles that happened outside of Spotify
